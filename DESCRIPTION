Description: SIF is a relatively lightweight and remarkably accurate sentence embedding approach, which in some tasks provides comparable performance to neural network based embedding models. The present SIF implementation is based on the [original](https://github.com/PrincetonML/SIF) algorithm as well as [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/procode/sif-embeddings-got-69-accuracy/notebook) notebook, which provides a slightly simplified approach. The implementation from the original authors included principal component removal after sentence embedding calculation, which I forgo in this project for simplicity.
